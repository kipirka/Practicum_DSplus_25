This project  evaluates a new feature adoption by a hotel.

First I do an EDA, then a preliminary model estimation to choose the relevant features,
then I do a full model choice using optuna. 
Finally, I estimated an expected profit distribution using bootstrap and do a hypethetical worst case schenario estimation
